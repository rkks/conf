* known_hosts - if fingerprint mismatch doing ssh, delete the respective entry from this file.
* authorized_keys2 - if RSA key generated for SSH2, add key to this file (without new line) on target machine.
* config - provides hostname aliases for ssh. Also, username provision
Host <FQDN>
    Hostname 1.2.7.4
    User ravikiranks
* Include directive - allows to include host/user specific config on need basis
* id_ed25519 - private keys for host which intends to do ssh login. generated by 'ssh-keygen -t ed25519' (generates SSH2 keys)
* id_ed25519.pub - public keys to be copied to .ssh/authorized_keys OR .ssh/authorized_keys2 file.

## EDCSA, ED25519
RSA based SHA-1 keys are deprecated. Client does not initiate ssh and also it
receives "permission denied" from Server if it is running OpenSSH v8.8 or above

Alternatively, one can generate EDCSA or ED25519 keys and use them.

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

In worst-case, to re-enable RSA,
do add to ~/.ssh/config:
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
do add to /etc/ssh/ssh_config:
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
    IPQoS none
